The following will be recorded and combined with the powerpoint to show to one of the groups

Slide 1: Thank you for participating in our study. Today we will be teaching you some of the African countries and their outlines.
You will need to learn these outlines and be able to label them with their correct country at the end of the learning period.

Slide 2: There are 54 countires in Africa. It would be difficult to learn all of them in such a short period so we will teach you 15 of them.
