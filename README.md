## Meetings:
   Currently we have been meeting at least once a week to ensure that the project is heading in the direction that we want and that aspects of the experiment are being completed in a timely manner


## General:
   Our experiment will be testing if there is a statistically significant difference between two forms of education: Powerpoint presentations or interactive learning. Upon gathering our participants they will be put into one of two groups. The first group will be given an interactive map where they can scroll around and click on countries in Africa to recieve information about that country including the shape of the contry itself. The other group will be presented with a prerecorded lecture where one of our group members will read from a script and present slides that contain the same amount of information as the interactive map. Once the participants are done with their respective educational medium they will be directed to a test where they are shown a silhouette of a country they previously learned about and will have to attempt to name the country. After they have taken the test there will be a rest period of a couple of days and then they will be tested again to see if their scores have changed. After this twe will comapre the test results of both groups and perform statistical analysis to determine if there is a quantifiable difference between the two forms of education. The video to the prototype is listed below.
